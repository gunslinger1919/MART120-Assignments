        One time a middle aged guy named Shawn decided that he hated his job and that he wanted to do better.  He knew a guy that wrote computer code and that guy broke it down to him what his job was and what it entailed.  Shawn thought it sounded like a pretty good gig so he decided that he wanted to learn all there was to know about it and all sorts of other things that he never got a chance to learn about.  So he decided to go to College!  Now Shawn hadn't been in school for close to 20 years because Shawn made a lot of dip shit choices when he was younger.  School was a challenge, especially because everything was done on computers now and he was more or less computer illiterate.  However, he put in the work that he needed to in order to master the science of computetrs.  Then he was attacked by a badger and died.  The end.
